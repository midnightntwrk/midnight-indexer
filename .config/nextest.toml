# Nextest configuration for midnight-indexer
# This configuration prevents nextest from cancelling long-running tests when other tests fail.
# This is particularly important for e2e tests which take >60 seconds to complete.

[profile.default]
# Don't cancel test execution on first failure
# This prevents issues where test_finalized_blocks_0_13 failure causes e2e.rs to be cancelled
fail-fast = false

# Terminate tests that take longer than 480s (240s * 2) to prevent indefinite hangs.
# The e2e test depends on block production which can stall; this ensures cleanup.
