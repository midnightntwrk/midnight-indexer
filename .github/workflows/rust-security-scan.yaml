# NOTE: This workflow uses 'pull_request' event (not 'pull_request_target') because we need to
# checkout and scan the PR code. This means fork PRs don't have access to secrets.
# We cannot use 'pull_request_target' because that would be unsafe - it would give untrusted
# fork PR code access to secrets.
#
# Fork PR behavior:
# - cargo-deny runs successfully (no secrets needed)
# - SARIF uploads to GitHub Security (no secrets needed)
# - netrc and Checkmarx BYOR upload are skipped (require secrets)
#
# This is acceptable because fork PRs still get security scanning via cargo-deny.
